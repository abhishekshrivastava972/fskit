FSKit
Version 0.1

FSKit is a FamilySearch API framework that makes it easy to 
develop FamilySearch applications using Objective-C and Cocoa.

==Getting Started==

Steps: 
1. Link in FSKit
2. Create a connection
3. Create a service with the connection
4. Make a call to the service and handle the results
5. Profit?? ;-)

All FamilySearch services can share the same FamilySearchConnection. The connection deals
with authentication and the common infrastructure needed for the services to connect to the correct URL
and retrieve the results.
