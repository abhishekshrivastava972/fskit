# Roadmap #

The first code has been posted to subversion. It has a rough structure and enough implementation to do a login and a simple person read.


## Release 0.1 ##

Initial release. Currently planned for March 12, 2008 to coincide with the FamilySearch developer conference. Should include enough structure to do all of the read-only APIs and basic syncing. Will try to include some update/write functionality if possible.

## Future ##

  * More unit tests
  * Update/write capability
  * Repositories/caches
  * Bindings support
  * Optional Core Data model?
