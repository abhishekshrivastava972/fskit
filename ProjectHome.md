FSKit is a Cocoa framework to help Mac OS X applications access the [FamilySearch.org](http://familysearch.org) public [web service APIs](https://devnet.familysearch.org/).

FSKit now works on the iPhone [iPhone search screenshot](http://bit.ly/7d71q) [demo movie](http://www.screencast.com/users/RedBugz/folders/Jing/media/5aa58b4a-9365-4d20-892e-4af4861aab6b)

FSKit is still in early development, and needs feedback and help with development. Please look at the initial code and sample app and provide feedback as to architecture, structure, usefulness, etc. and we would gratefully appreciate your code contributions as well. Lets make FSKit a great API for the next generation of Macintosh and iPhone genealogy applications!
