<h1>NSObject(FSKConnectionDelegate)</h1>
<hr>
<b>Extends&nbsp;Class:</b><!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSObject" --><p>NSObject<!-- /a --><br></p>

<hr>
<br><br><br><p>
The FSKConnectionDelegate category on NSObject defines
FSKConnection delegate methods that can be implemented by
objects to receive informational callbacks about the asynchronous
load of a URL request. Other delegate methods provide hooks that
allow the delegate to customize the process of performing an
asynchronous URL load.
<br><br></p>
<p>Note that all these will be called on the thread that started
the asynchronous load operation on the associated FSKConnection
object.
</p>
<p>The following contract governs the delivery of the callbacks
defined in this interface:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero or more <tt>-connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:</tt> 
messages will be sent to the delegate before any other messages in this
list are sent.
</li>
<li>Before receiving a response or processing a redirect,
<tt>connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:</tt> may be
received if authentication is required.
</li>
<li>Zero or more <tt>connection:didReceiveResponse:</tt> messages
will be sent to the delegate before receiving a
<tt>-connection:didReceiveData:</tt> message. In rare cases, as will
occur in an HTTP load where the content type of the load data is
multipart/x-mixed-replace, the delegate will receive more than one
<tt>connection:didReceiveResponse:</tt> message. In the event this
occurs, delegates should discard all data previously delivered by
way of the <tt>-connection:didReceiveData:</tt>, and should be
prepared to handle the, potentially different, MIME type reported by
the NSURLResponse. Note that the only case where a response is not
sent to a delegate is when the protocol implemenation encounters an
error before a response could be created.
</li>
<li>Zero or more <tt>connection:didReceiveData:</tt> messages will
be sent before and of the following messages are sent to the
delegate:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>connection:willCacheResponse:</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>-connectionDidFinishLoading:</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>-connection:didFailWithError:</tt>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zero or one <tt>connection:willCacheResponse:</tt> messages will
be sent to the delegate after <tt>connection:didReceiveData:</tt>
are sent but before a <tt>-connectionDidFinishLoading:</tt> message
is sent.
</li>
<li>Unless a FSKConnection receives a <tt>-cancel</tt> message,
the delegate will receive one and only one of
<tt>-connectionDidFinishLoading:</tt>, or
<tt>-connection:didFailWithError:</tt> message, but never
both. In addition, once either of these callbacks is sent, the
delegate will receive no further callbacks of any kind for the
given FSKConnection. 
</li>
</ul>
